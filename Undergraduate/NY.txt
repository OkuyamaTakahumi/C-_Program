At the end of 1900, Ban Johnson, president of the American League, 
a minor league, previously known as the Western League (1894â€“9), 
reorganized the league. He added teams in three east coast cities, 
forming the American League (AL) as a major league in an attempt to 
challenge the National League (NL) for supremacy. Plans to put a 
team in New York City were blocked by the NL's New York Giants, 
who had enough political power in New York City to prevent 
the AL from establishing a team. Instead, 
a team was put in Baltimore, Maryland, a city which 
the NL abandoned when it contracted from 12 to 8 teams in 1900.

Nicknamed the Orioles, the team began playing in 1901, 
and were managed and partly owned by John McGraw. 
During the 1902 season, McGraw feuded with Johnson, and 
secretly jumped to the Giants. In the middle of the season, 
the Giants, aided and abetted by McGraw, gained controlling 
interest of the Orioles and began raiding it for players, 
until the AL stepped in and took control of the team. In January 1903, a 
"peace conference" was held between the two leagues to settle disputes 
and try to coexist. At the conference, Johnson requested that an AL 
team be put in New York, to play alongside the NL's Giants.[7] It was put to a vote,
 and 15 of the 16 Major League owners agreed on it, with 
 only John T. Brush of the Giants opposing. The Orioles' new owners, 
 Frank J. Farrell and William S. Devery, found a ballpark location not blocked by the Giants,
  and Baltimore's team moved to New York.
